Setting Up:
# Virtual Environment:
Whenever starting a new project, you need to create a virtual environment for all your packages to be installed in:

```python3 -m venv env ```

*"env"* is the name of the environment
â€‹
When the new environment has been created, you can tell by looking at the bottom left hand corner of visual studio code:

To activate the virtual environment, do the following command in the terminal:

```source env/bin/activate```

*"env/activate/bin"* is the directory of the activate script
